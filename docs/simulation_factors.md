# Football Match Simulation Factors

A comprehensive list of factors for a detailed football match simulation:

1. **Player Ratings by Position**
   - Compare each player's rating to their direct opponent (e.g., striker vs. center back, midfielder vs. midfielder).
   - Factor in injuries, suspensions, and fatigue for even more realism.

2. **Home Team Advantage**
   - Give a small boost to the home team's performance (e.g., +5% to all ratings or a flat bonus to goal probability).

3. **Team Form**
   - Use recent results (last 5 matches) to adjust morale and performance (winning streak = higher confidence, losing streak = pressure).

4. **Morale**
   - Adjust team and player performance based on morale, which can be influenced by form, big wins/losses, or off-field events.

5. **Coach/Manager Skill**
   - Use manager and coach ratings to influence tactics, substitutions, and overall team organization.

6. **Team Chemistry**
   - Teams with stable lineups and long-serving players may perform better together.

7. **Squad Depth/Fatigue**
   - Teams with more depth can rotate players and avoid fatigue, especially in congested fixture periods.

8. **Injuries/Suspensions**
   - Remove or weaken players who are unavailable.

9. **Tactics/Formation**
   - Adjust how teams play (defensive, attacking, possession, counter-attack) and how well their formation matches up against the opponent.

10. **Randomness/“Luck”**
    - Always include a small random factor to allow for upsets and surprises.

11. **Weather/Conditions (optional)**
    - Bad weather can reduce the effectiveness of technical teams or favor physical teams.

12. **Referee Strictness (optional)**
    - Some referees give more cards or penalties, affecting the match.

For each match, calculate a “team strength” score for both teams using all the above factors. Use these scores to bias the probability of each possible result (win/draw/loss). For goals, simulate each attack/defense event using player-vs-player ratings, adjusted by the above factors.
